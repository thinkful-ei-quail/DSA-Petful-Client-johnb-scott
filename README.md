# Petful
### Built by: John Bowser & Scott Whiteman

Petful is a pet adoption website that ensures pets don't wait too long to get adopted
Pets that arrive here are placed in a queue and are adopted on a first in first out basis.
If you would like to adopt a pet you will be placed in line, once it is your turn you will have the option to adopt the currently available dog, cat, or both.
